# AstroCode

Various code I've written for undergrad research at the College of Charleston.

The code ranges from converting Julien days to dates, heliocentric Julien days, and barycentric Julien days to photometry,
plotting and data reduction. 

Most of the code is specific to my research group, such as a telescopePROCESS.py for processing with specific telescopes (CTIO, MDM, SALT) and plot.py plotting code to make uniform graphs. More general code like Process.py can be used for any telescope. Plot.py can easily be editted to specific parameters. 

Some have an option to input a .csv file with all of the logic parameters to cut down on user-inputs and avoid errors easier.
